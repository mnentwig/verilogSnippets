# verilogSnippets
collection of Verilog code samples e.g. for FPGA

### asynchronous FIFO with valid/ready protocol

### testbench with PN data source

### axiToReadyValid
AXI-lite slave with four ready-/valid ports

### axiMaster
AXI-lite master (largely for simulation)

### workflow
- makefile for MinGW
- .bat file for mapping directory to f: drive on windows (ugly but efficient approach to managing path names)
